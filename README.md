# grapqhl-serverless-micro

Simple API developed with Node.js and Typescript, which includes a series of Serverless Functions to deploy with Vercel, and which also includes an ApolloServer with the `apollo-server-micro` library. Added also `mongoose` and some MongoDB models to then switch to a real database instead of mocked data.

### Endpoints
